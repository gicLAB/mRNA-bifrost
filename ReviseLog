This file is created in 2018/09/25 to record the significant change in relative class organization.

1. Class revise in PIISACNNAnalyzer class:

1) Combine wirteProfile and writeRunandEnergy function into one and change there arguments from

    void writeProfile(std::ofstream& profile, std::vector<std::pair<int, double> > configinfo, double onchip,
                      std::vector<double> partialsum, int kernelch, int kernelfil, std::vector<int> cycleinfo)

    void writeRunandEnergy(std::ofstream& profile, std::vector<int> realcycle, std::vector<double> dsn_eng, std::vector<double> msn_eng,
                           std::vector<double> rsn_eng, std::vector<double> spm_eng, double dram_eng)

to void writeProfile(MappingStrategy*);

2) revise the output format to:

    Output File Should specify:
    Mapping:
    - Size of VN: <k_x, k_y, c>
    - Number of VNs:
    - Number of Idle MS:

    DN:
    - number of unicasts for weights:
    - number of multicasts for weights:
    - size of multicast for weights: <effectively number of VNs>
    - number of unicasts for inputs:
    - number of multicasts for inputs:
    - size of multicast for inputs:
    [Note: number of weights read from SRAM = number of unicast for weights + number of multicast for weights. Similarly for inputs]

    RN:
    - number of additons
    - number of reductions (i.e., number of unique outputs generated)

    MN:
    - number of multiplications
    - number of local forwards

    VNAT:
    - number of outputs expected: <calculate theoretically using DNN params)
    - number of outputs received:   --> this will validate that the compiler is correct

    Prefetch Buffer
    - number of weights read: <should be equal to number of unicast + number of multicast in DN>
    - number of inputs read:
    - number of outputs written:

    Performance:
    - Number of control steps:
    - Total Runtime (cycles):

    Code Size:
    - ... (edited)

3ï¼‰Add void parseconfig(std::ifstream config) function to parse the information such as energy and instruction length of ISA inside the configuration file.

4) Revise calculateDSN() function from
